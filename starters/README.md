# 📦 Flutter AI Builders Circle – Starters

Welcome to the **Starters Hub** of the Flutter AI Builders Circle.

This section offers high-quality, community-vetted resources to help you explore and build **agentic apps** using Flutter and AI — from basic LLM integrations to more advanced workflows using RAG, MCP, and Whisper.

> 🧠 We believe in learning by doing — and starting with official sources. All links below come from official documentation or deeply trusted platforms.
