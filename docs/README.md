## Our Focus

We’re a community of Flutter developers and AI explorers — from curious newcomers 
to experienced builders — learning and building together in real time.

As the AI landscape evolves, so do we.  
Instead of declaring fixed goals, our current focus is to:

- 🧠 Explore how AI can enhance Flutter development  
- 📖 Share trusted resources and working examples  
- 🛠️ Build and test open-source prototypes and tools  
- 🤝 Create a collaborative space for experimentation and collective learning  

This is a living space — shaped by the questions we ask, the things we try, and what we discover along the way.


## Get Involved

Whether you're an AI expert or just getting started with Flutter, there's a place for you in our community.

- **Explore** our starter kits to see what's possible
- **Learn** through our sample projects and documentation
- **Contribute** your own ideas and improvements
- **Connect** with fellow Flutter AI enthusiasts *(Coming Soon)*

## Why Flutter + AI?

Flutter's cross-platform capabilities combined with modern AI services create an ideal environment for building intelligent, responsive applications that run everywhere.

Our goal is to make these technologies more accessible to the entire Flutter community through high-quality examples and starter templates.
